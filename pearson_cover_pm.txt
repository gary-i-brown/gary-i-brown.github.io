Thank you for taking the time to review my CV for consideration of a Product Management 
position at Pearson.

I've had great opportunities to work at nearly all levels of product development from
independent contributor to VP of Product Development.  I've long had a desire to work at 
the cusp of development and business to guide product strategy.

I look forward to discussing my background and what I can bring to Pearson in Product
Management.

Product development and particularly the process of delivering high quality products 
through great people is a passion of mine.  I look forward to discussing what 
contributions I can provide for Pearson.

Thanks,
Gary
