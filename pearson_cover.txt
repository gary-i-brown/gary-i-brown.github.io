Thank you for taking the time to review my CV for consideration of a Software Engineering 
position at Pearson.

You will note that this past year I've taken some time off to pursue the growth of 
possible product ideas.  I'm happy to discuss the scope and domain of these ideas at any 
time.  That time of research and writing has come to an end.  I'm now pursuing full time 
contribution.

I look forward to answering any questions you may have about this or any of the other 
background items I've provided.

Software development and particularly the process of delivering high quality products 
through great people is a passion of mine.  I look forward to discussing what 
contributions I can provide for Pearson.

Thanks,
Gary
